# Classic Commands

Classic commands are commands that are sent into the regular chat with the bot prefix.

These commands often have aliases. You can see those, and some additional information, by running the [documentation command](#docs) (example: `docs [command-name]`).

## Categories

### üó®Ô∏è Chatting

#### hello

Usage:

`image gigachad People who use Nim`

`image nerdemoji "Heyyy YouTube, welcome to another prank video!!!!"`

#### echo / echodel

Usage:

`echo Hello World`

`echodel Uhhh spooky, where did my initial message go??`

#### truth-o-meter

Usage:

`truth-o-meter Are cats worse than dogs?` (9%, totally unbiased pick)

`truth-o-meter Will tomorrow be a good day?` (55%, it is up to you :3)

#### love-o-meter

`love-o-meter @AnotherUser` (@AnotherUser and you are evaluated)

#### yes-no-maybe

Randomly respons with yes, no or maybe to a question. This is purely random, and does not stay constant with the question.
