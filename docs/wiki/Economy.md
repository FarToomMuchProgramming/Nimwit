# Economy

!!! Economy is still heavily in development. !!!

## Daily Command

You can get your daily money using the [daily command](ClassicCommands.md#daily). The amount starts off at 500 and gradually rises with your daily streaks.

If you break your streak, your daily rewards will be reset to 500.

## Chatting

Another way you can earn money is by passively chatting. Every message you send is worth 1 money. This is a temporary feature and will probably change a lot.

Beware: You can spam to receive more money, though it is not worth it and please do not annoy other members while doing so!
